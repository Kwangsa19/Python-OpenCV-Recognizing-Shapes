# Python-OpenCV-Image-Processing
> This project is based on Coursera project course("Recognizing shapes in images with OpenCV"). For full explanation and information, please visit this [link](https://www.coursera.org/projects/recognizing-shapes-images-opencv) to enroll the course. 
> Here, I used OpenCV to load and compute an image from file, detect edges, recognize lines and circles. 

## Tasks

The following are what I did in this project: 
* Load an image from file
* Compute image gradients
* Detect edges in an image using Canny edge detection
* Recognize lines in an image using Hough transforms
* Recognize circles in an image using Hough transforms

## Requirements

The following modules and knowledge you have to prepare: 
* OpenCV module (cv2)
* Numpy module (numpy)
* Os (os)
* Hough transform theory

## Implementation
